I have Hugo installed and have run `hugo new site 84em.ai`. I need you to build out a complete, production-ready Hugo site structure.

## About the Site
- Domain: 84em.ai
- Purpose: Personal AI resource site where I share AI workflows, discoveries, tool reviews, and practical applications I've found useful
- Author: Andrew Miller (I also run 84em.com, a WordPress development consultancy)
- Tone: Direct, practical, no-hype. Written by a developer for people who want to actually use this stuff.

## Technical Requirements
- Zero JavaScript (or absolute minimum vanilla JS only if essential)
- No external dependencies, no frameworks, no build tools beyond Hugo
- System font stack (no web fonts)
- Single CSS file, minimal and hand-written
- Mobile-first responsive design
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant (semantic HTML, skip links, proper focus states, sufficient contrast, proper heading hierarchy)
- Perfect or near-perfect PageSpeed scores
- Structured data (JSON-LD) for articles and site
- Comprehensive meta tags including Open Graph and Twitter cards
- XML sitemap and RSS feed
- robots.txt optimized for both traditional search engines and AI crawlers/LLMs (AESO)

## Pages Needed
- Home: Brief intro, recent posts
- Posts section: Blog listing and individual post template
- About: Who I am, why this site exists
- 404 page

## Content Management
- All content in Markdown
- Simple frontmatter (title, date, description, tags)
- Easy for an LLM to create new posts by just adding .md files

Build out the complete file structure with all layouts, partials, CSS, and config. Make it minimal but complete—nothing I'd need to rip out later.
