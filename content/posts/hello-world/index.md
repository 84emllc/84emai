This is the first post on 84EM.AI.

I've been using AI tools in my development work for a while now. Some of it works well. Some of it doesn't. I'm going to start documenting what I learn here.

## What to expect

Posts will cover:

- **Workflows** - How I actually use AI tools in day-to-day work
- **Tool reviews** - Honest takes on what's worth your time
- **Discoveries** - Interesting things I stumble across
- **Practical applications** - Real examples, not hypotheticals

## What not to expect

- Affiliate links
- Sponsored content
- "10 AI tools that will change your life" listicles

Just notes from the field.
