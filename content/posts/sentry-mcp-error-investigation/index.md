I use [Sentry](https://sentry.io) to monitor site errors on 84em.com. When something breaks, I get a Slack notification and can dig into the stack trace, affected URLs, and error frequency.

This works fine, but it means context switching: leave what I'm doing, open the dashboard, click through the issue, read the stack trace, figure out what's happening.

## A better workflow

I installed the [Sentry MCP](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/packages/mcp-sentry) in Claude Code. Now when I get an error notification, I can ask Claude to investigate it directly.

Claude fetches the issue from Sentry, analyzes the stack trace, checks the timeline of occurrences, and produces a full write-up. In this case, it determined that 749 HTTP 500/503 errors were coming from FlyingPress cache preloading during brief server availability issues - not a code bug, just infrastructure noise.

The analysis included:

- **Error details** - Issue ID, first/last seen dates, total occurrences, affected environment
- **Stack trace origin** - Which plugin and function threw the exception
- **Timeline analysis** - When the errors occurred and likely causes
- **Root cause** - Why this is expected behavior during deployments or high load
- **Resolution** - Mark as resolved, no code changes needed
- **Recommendations** - Filter suggestions to reduce noise

## The takeaway

I can investigate production errors without ever logging into Sentry. Get a notification, ask Claude to look into it, get a detailed analysis. The MCP handles authentication and API calls behind the scenes.

One less dashboard to check.
