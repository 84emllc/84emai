84EM.AI is where I document what I'm learning about AI tools.

Workflows that hold up in real projects. Tools worth the setup time. Practical applications that go beyond demos. No breathless predictions or dismissive skepticism.

## What you'll find here

AI coverage tends toward extremes. I'm more interested in what actually works day-to-day: Claude Code for development, automation pipelines, tool comparisons based on real usage.

I write about what I use, not what's trending.
