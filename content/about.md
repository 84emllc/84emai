![Andrew Miller](images/headshot-150.webp)

I'm Andrew Miller, a WordPress developer and consultant who runs [84EM](https://84em.com).

This site is where I share what I'm learning about AI: workflows that actually work, tools worth using, and practical applications I've found useful in my day-to-day work.

No hype, no breathless "this changes everything" predictions. Just notes from someone who's trying to use these tools effectively.

## Why this site

AI tools are moving fast. Most coverage falls into two camps: dismissive skepticism or uncritical enthusiasm. Neither is helpful when you're trying to figure out what to actually use.

I'm documenting what works for me. Some of it might work for you too.
